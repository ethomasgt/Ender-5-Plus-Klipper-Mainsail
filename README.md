# Ender-5-Plus-Klipper-Mainsail
Klipper configuration for Ender 5 plus with SKR3 EZ, TMC 2009 stepper drivers, sprite pro extruder, Led Bar (35 chain), and AXDL345in), AXDL345 sensor, and arducam.

Added shell command through Kiuah 
Using Led Effect from https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect/blob/master/docs/LED_Effect.md. 
Using macros from jschuh--https://github.com/jschuh/klipper-macros  I edited the start end macro to include led effects during heating, probing, park, printing, and print end.

Enjoy
