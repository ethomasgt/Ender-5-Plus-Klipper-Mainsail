This klipper configuration is for my modified Ender 5 Plus. 
Hardware additions/modifications include SKR3 EZ board with TMC2009 silient drivers, sprite pro extruder, Led Bar (35 chain), AXDL sensor, and arducam.

Added shell command through Kiuah 
Using Led Effect from https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect/blob/master/docs/LED_Effect.md. 
Using macros from jschuh--https://github.com/jschuh/klipper-macros  I edited the start end macro to include led effects during heating, probing, park, printing, and print end.

Enjoy
